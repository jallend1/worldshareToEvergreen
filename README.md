# Extract Data From WorldShare Requests to Insert into the Evergreen ILS

## What does it do?

Extracts the WorldShare request number, title, and patron barcode from a OCLC WorldShare request.

## How do I use it?

1. Copy the code from record-min.js to your clipboard.
2. Head over to Chrome and right-click on the bookmarks bar and click "Add Page"
3. Give it a name that's useful for you. Like "Extract From OCLC" or something more clever.
4. Under the URL, paste the code you copied from record-min.js
5. When you have a request loaded, press the bookmark shortcut and BAM. The info is in your clipboard.
6. Flip over to your label program and hit CTRL-V to paste it and you're off to the races.

## It doesn't work for me. 

That seems likely. This is just cobbled together to make my workflow easier and isn't broadly tested
outside of the situations I use it in. You can absolutely reach out to me with any questions, and 
I can see what I can do.
